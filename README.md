GetherBook - A Real-time Digital Note-Taking Platform

Our project, GetherBook, is a platform for students to enhance their studying experience by creating a more productive space for students to interact with each other and share notes in real time. While this platform is created for students, it is versatile and can be used in other scenarios with large groups of people such as business meetings and any team-related activities..
